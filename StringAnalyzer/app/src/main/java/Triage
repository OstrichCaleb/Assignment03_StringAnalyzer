BUG #1 / Critical / Nexus 5X / Version 8.0
DESCRIPTION: App crashes when you hit submit
REPRODUCTION STEPS: On the main activity, once the submit button is clicked, with or without text added in the TextEntry field
                    android.content.ActivityNotFoundException:
ERROR FOUND IN MONITOR: "Unable to find explicit activity class {co.miniforge.corey.stringanalyzer/co.miniforge.corey.stringanalyzer.
                         TextAnalyzerUtil}; have you declared this activity in your AndroidManifest.xml?"
LOCATION IN CODE: InputActivity.java around line 32 when the on click listener
          is set, as the button is clicked it attempts to call a function
          from the TextAnalyzerUtil.java class which has not been added to
          the AndroidManifest.xml. The most likely reason for this is that
          the class was just added in without it realizing to change the xml
          to  be able to use the class. (round 2) Also the constrtucting call for the
          TextAnalyzerUtil was not being passed a string for the constructor
          so the new intent line had to change.
SOLUTION: Change the AndroidManifest.xml by adding an activity for TextAnalyzerUtil.
      (round 2) Change the new intent line to move to AnalyzerActivity instead of the TextAnalyzerUtil.
IMPACT: Now noticed that the play again button does not work
