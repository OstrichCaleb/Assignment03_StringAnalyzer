BUG #1 / Critical / Nexus 5X / Version 8.0
DESCRIPTION: App crashes when you hit submit
REPRODUCTION STEPS: On the main activity, once the submit button is clicked, with or without text added in the TextEntry field
                    android.content.ActivityNotFoundException:
ERROR FOUND IN MONITOR: "Unable to find explicit activity class {co.miniforge.corey.stringanalyzer/co.miniforge.corey.stringanalyzer.
                         TextAnalyzerUtil}; have you declared this activity in your AndroidManifest.xml?"
LOCATION IN CODE: InputActivity.java around line 32 when the on click listener
          is set, as the button is clicked it attempts to call a function
          from the TextAnalyzerUtil.java class which has not been added to
          the AndroidManifest.xml. The most likely reason for this is that
          the class was just added in without it realizing to change the xml
          to  be able to use the class. (round 2) Also the constrtucting call for the
          TextAnalyzerUtil was not being passed a string for the constructor
          so the new intent line had to change.
SOLUTION: Change the AndroidManifest.xml by adding an activity for TextAnalyzerUtil.
      (round 2) Change the new intent line to move to AnalyzerActivity instead of the TextAnalyzerUtil.
IMPACT: Now noticed that the play again button does not work

BUG #2 / Normal / Nexus 5X / Version 8.0
DESCRIPTION: Analyze another string button doesnâ€™t take you back to the first screen
REPRODUCTION STEPS: After getting stats about my string, the button that allows you to enter a new string
                    does not function correctily and bring you back an activity
ERROR FOUND IN MONITOR: Unable to find explicit activity class {co.miniforge.corey.stringanalyzer/co.miniforge.corey
                        .stringanalyzer.TextAnalyzerUtil}; have you declared this activity in your AndroidManifest.xml?"
LOCATION IN CODE:   There was no on click listener looking for the button to be pushed, after adding one
                    I was able to send to a new activity using intents, directing me back to the home
                    page.
SOLUTION:   Added a new on click listener that waited for the button to be pushed, and when it was it would
            create a new intent allowing it to switch to the main activity again.
IMPACT: The game was fully functional for being able to play again

BUG #3 / Normal / Nexus 5X / Version 8.0
DESCRIPTION: Some of the metrics are not updating with new data
REPRODUCTION STEPS: After entering a string, the fields that displayed unique words and longest words did
                    not show the correct data.
ERROR FOUND IN MONITOR: There was no error, it just didn't display the correct info
LOCATION IN CODE:   There was no setText for the TextViews that were supposed to display the information.
SOLUTION:   Added a setText for the information that called the methods that were in the TextAnalyzerUtil
            class that returned a string for one and an int for the other
IMPACT: All the correct information was showed for the word

BUG #4 / Low / Nexus 5X / Version 8.0
DESCRIPTION: You can submit an empty message
REPRODUCTION STEPS: I entered nothing and it went anyway
ERROR FOUND IN MONITOR: There was no check to see if the EditText had something before switching intents
LOCATION IN CODE:   Above where you go and create the intent there was no check for the entry
SOLUTION:   Added a check to see if the text entry was empty or not, and if it was not it didn't
            do anything until the button was clicked again
IMPACT: You could no longer go to the results screen without entering a word
